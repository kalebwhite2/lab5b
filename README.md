1a. The rightmost bit of roundrobin changes at a rate of 100e6/2^17. Each four iterations of the rightmost bit, a particular digit is revisited. 100e6/4(2^17) = 191Hz.
1b. 1.31 ms = 1000 ms/s / 100e6/2^17 bits/second.

2. There's twice as many digits, so to light up each digit at the same frequency, each digit would have to be lit half as long. Dividing the previous calculation by 2 gives 0.655ms.

3. h'29. h'F029.
  
4. floor(100e6 / 1174.66Hz) = 85131.
